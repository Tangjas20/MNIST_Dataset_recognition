**Tensorflow/Keras CNN and SKLearn SVM Implementation On MNIST Dataset**

Data:
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large
database of handwritten digits. The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing
images. This database is widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.



This project implements a CNN sequential model with an accuracy of 98.84% using Google Colaboratory P100 GPU with a running time of 84 seconds or 1 minute and 24 seconds

The KNN achieves an accuracy of 97.71% with a running time of 311 seconds or 5 minutes and 11 seconds. 



Both models were tested on the same hardware however it was noticed that CNN took advantage of the computational resources whilst SVM performance marginally improved.
